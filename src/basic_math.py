# This script demonstrates basic arithmetic and comparison operations in Python.

# Basic arithmetic operations
print(3 + 2) # Addition. Output: 5
print("3 + 2") # String representation of addition. Output: 3 + 2
print(5 - 1) # Subtraction. Output: 4
print(3 * 4) # Multiplication. Output: 12
print(10 / 5) # Division. Output: 2.0
print(35 % 3) # Modulus (remainder of division). Output: 2
print(2 ** 4) # Exponentiation. Output: 16
print(3.0 - 1) # Subtraction with floating point number. Output: 2.0

# Using f-strings to print the results of arithmetic operations
print(f"3 + 2 = {3 + 2}") # Addition. Output: 3 + 2 = 5
print(f"5 - 1 = {5 - 1}") # Subtraction. Output: 5 - 1 = 4
print(f"3 * 4 = {3 * 4}") # Multiplication. Output: 3 * 4 = 12
print(f"10 / 5 = {10 / 5}") # Division. Output: 10 / 5 = 2.0
print(f"35 % 3 = {35 % 3}") # Modulus (remainder of division). Output: 35 % 3 = 2
print(f"2 ** 4 = {2 ** 4}") # Exponentiation. Output: 2 ** 4 = 16

# Comparison operations
print(5 == 1) # Equal to. Output: False (because 5 is not equal to 1)
print(5 != 1) # Not equal to. Output: True (because 5 is not equal to 1)
print(5 > 1) # Greater than. Output: True (because 5 is greater than 1)
print(5 >= 1) # Greater than or equal to. Output: True (because 5 is greater than 1)
print(5 < 1) # Less than. Output: False (because 5 is not less than 1)
print(5 <= 1) # Less than or equal to. Output: False (because 5 is not less than 1)

# Using f-strings to print the results of comparison operations
print(f"5 == 1: {5 == 1}") # Equal to. Output: 5 == 1: False (because 5 is not equal to 1)
print(f"5 != 1: {5 != 1}") # Not equal to. Output: 5 != 1: True (because 5 is not equal to 1)
print(f"5 > 1: {5 > 1}") # Greater than. Output: 5 > 1: True (because 5 is greater than 1)
print(f"5 >= 1: {5 >= 1}") # Greater than or equal to. Output: 5 >=1: True (because 5 is greater than 1)
print(f"5 < 1: {5 < 1}") # Less than. Output: 5 < 1: False (because 5 is not less than 1)
print(f"5 <= 1: {5 <= 1}") # Less than or equal to. Output: 5 <= 1: False (because 5 is not less than 1)
