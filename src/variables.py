# This script demonstrates basic variable assignments and operations in Python.

my_name = "Austin Graham"  # Assigning a string to the variable my_name
print(my_name)  # Printing the value of my_name to the console

number_1 = 5  # Assigning an integer to number_1
number_2 = 10  # Assigning an integer to number_2
print(number_1 + number_2)  # Printing the sum of number_1 and number_2

fruit_1 = "apples"  # Assigning a string to fruit_1
fruit_2 = "oranges"  # Assigning a string to fruit_2
print(fruit_1 + fruit_2)  # Printing the concatenation of fruit_1 and fruit_2

fruit_1 = "apples"  # Assigning a string to fruit_1
fruit_2 = "oranges"  # Assigning a string to fruit_2
print("I like " + fruit_1 + " and I like " + fruit_2 + ".")  # Concatenating strings for output

fruit_1 = "apples"  # Assigning a string to fruit_1
fruit_2 = "oranges"  # Assigning a string to fruit_2
print(f"I like {fruit_1} and I like {fruit_2}.")  # Using f-string for formatted output

fruit_1 = "apples"  # Assigning a string to fruit_1
print(fruit_1 * 5)  # Printing the string fruit_1 repeated 5 times
