# Python Intro
*Python Programming Exercises - Beginner's Guide*

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python exercises and examples I completed while following the *Intro to Python Programming - Beginner's Guide Series* by John Elder. The exercises cover basic programming concepts and are designed to help beginners get familiar with Python syntax and functionality. This series has been an excellent resource for building foundational Python skills.

## Contents
Each file in this repository covers specific Python programming concepts:

1. **hello_world.py**: A simple program that outputs "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. **basic_math.py**: Demonstrates basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. **variables.py**: Introduces the concept of variables, showing how to declare and use them in Python.
4. **assign_ops.py**: Explores assignment operations and how to update variables using various operators.
5. **user_input.py**: Shows how to take user input and interact with users via the console.
6. **if_else.py**: Introduces conditional statements, including `if`, `else`, and `elif`, to control program flow.
7. **adventure.py**: A simple text-based adventure game that uses branching choices to guide the player through different story paths based on their decisions.
8. **lists.py**: Demonstrates list operations, including creating lists, nested lists, and performing common operations on lists.
9. **loops.py**: Covers loops, including `for` and `while` loops, for iterating over data structures or executing repetitive tasks.
10. **fizz_buzz.py**: A classic programming challenge that prints "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both.
11. **functions.py**: Introduces functions, showcasing how to define reusable blocks of code with parameters and return values.
12. **dictionaries.py**: Demonstrates the use of dictionaries for storing key-value pairs and includes examples of adding, updating, and deleting entries.
13. **math_game.py**: A math flashcard game where users can practice addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through randomly generated questions. The game provides feedback on answers and allows users to continue or restart at any point.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run these Python scripts, you’ll need Python installed on your computer. If you haven’t installed Python, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kyoriku/python-intro.git
```

Navigate to the repository folder:
```bash
    cd python-intro
```

You can then run any of the Python files with:
```bash
    python3 src/<filename>.py
```

For example, to run the `math_game.py` script:
```bash
    python3 src/math_game.py
```

## Learning Goals
These exercises helped me build hands-on experience in the following areas:

- Working with basic Python syntax, variables, and data types
- Utilizing control flow statements like `if`, `else`, and `elif`
- Understanding and applying functions and their parameters
- Using lists, dictionaries, and loops for managing data
- Developing simple interactive programs like text-based games and flashcards
- Managing user input and providing feedback to users
